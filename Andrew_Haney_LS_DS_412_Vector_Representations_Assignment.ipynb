Evaluate the balance of supply and demand across time and geography, investigate how Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products shape riders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expectations and behavior over time, assess how drivers respond to variation in their earnings, and examine how potential regulation changes could impact the health of the marketplace. Leverage techniques from a variety of disciplines, including operations research, statistics and economics, to address these open-ended questions.\\nDriver Pricing | Develop advanced and real-time pricing algorithms and driver tools that shape how drivers plan, move, and earn. Use elements of modeling, causal inference, forecasting, and optimization to design prices that dynamically align driver's interests with those of riders and Uber's business.\\nMarketplace Forecasting | Stand upstream of the marketplace optimization flow and generate time series and machine learning models for quantities like trips, demand, and supply. Empower downstream optimization decisions such as pricing and incentive allocation with these forecasts of varying levels of spatial/temporal granularity and different forecast horizons. Capture calendar patterns and shocks (holidays, events, and weather) using a combination of classical time series and statistical and machine learning approaches in a scalable way.\\nMarketplace Investments | Manage the macroeconomics of our rides marketplace. Every year, Uber spends billions of dollars to influence our marketplace toward healthy growth by deploying a variety of incentives and pricing levers. Develop the algorithms that decide how to invest across all our levers, across all our markets, and what it means to operationalize for healthy, more profitable growth.
